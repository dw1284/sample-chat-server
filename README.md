Technologies Used
-----------------

##### Http Routing
  - node.js
  - express
  
##### Database
  - postgresql
  - sequelize
  
##### Authentication
  - jwt-simple (json-web-tokens)
  
##### Testing
  - mocha
  - chai
  - chai-http
  - proxyquire
  
Dependencies
------------
Required installs:
  - node.js
  - postgresql
  
Once you have installed postgresql, open the terminal and create the database and user:

You will need to create a database called **sample_api**:

```shell
createdb sample_api
```

Next, start up psql and connect to the **sample_api** database:

```shell
psql sample_api
```

Create a user and grant access to sample_api database:

```shell
CREATE USER svc_sampleapi_dev WITH PASSWORD 'P6zIAwuvuNWo';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE "sample_api" to svc_sampleapi_dev;
```

You should now be able to run **npm install** and then **npm start**. Sequelize will produce all of your database tables on startup.
